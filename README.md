# bookmarks-extension

Made w Claude and Cursor.

- Renders bookmarks in a dense, file explorer like format. 
- Groups bookmarks by main site url if more than one item. 
- Renders two tables. Top table is single item bookmarks, bottom table is grouped bookmarks.
- Prepend a bookmark title with `[P]` to bold the title and pin it to the top of it's respective group.
  - Opinion: Unique urls like `claude.ai` will be rendered in the main table. Pinning the bookmark makes for quick access.

**Install** this extension by cloning this repository and selecting `Load Unpacked` from the Chrome extensions menu w developer mode on.
